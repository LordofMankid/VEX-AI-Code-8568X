/*

 Create a chassis class that: 
 Takes 4 motor objects in its constructor
 Configure them for X-Drive/Regular drive as specified (so we can call chassis.xDrivePower(), chassis.regDrivePower())
  *no need for loops here 
 Provide basic auton functions that move to a given X, Y (for X-drive) and move a certain distance forward(for reg drive). Make a wheel constant for measuring  distance

 *this'll be used as a base for all classes involving the chassis
 *document so we can understand your thinking and give feedback
